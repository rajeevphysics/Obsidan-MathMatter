Magnetic potential energy how willing a magnet is to rotate

**Key equation:**

For situations where there is a magnetic field and magnetic moment
$U = -\mu \cdot\vec{B} \cdot cos{(\theta)}$


Magnetic potential energy is the magnet's wiliness to rotate or express a torque to align with a field.

Similar idea to [[Gravitational Potential energy]] the more misaligned the magnet is with the field, the **more potential energy is has** its wants to align with the field

$$\begin{array}{c} U = -\mu \cdot \vec{B} \\
U = I\cdot A \cdot \vec{B} \\
\text{Because its a dot poduct we could also write:} \\
U = -\mu \cdot\vec{B} \cdot cos{(\theta)} 
\end{array}$$
To rotate the magnet must experience a torque  ([[Magnetic Force & Torque#Torque on a current wire]])

>[!note] Explanation
The less algined with the field the more potential energy is has, **Red has the most potential energy** and **green has the least**

Electrons moving with spin ([[Quantum Mech Spin Of Electron (Intrinsic angular momentum)]]) around the nucelous.
When the electrons orbits the nucleus it creates an electric field which crares small magnetic dipole. The sum of these dipole creates magnetic fields

A electron creates a magnetic dipole through experimental results and solving the dirac equation

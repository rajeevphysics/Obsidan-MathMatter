A material used between [[Capacitors]] acting as an insulator. 

This increases capacitance (C) as less voltage (V) is able to move through. The charge (Q) doesn't change. 

When a delectric is inserted inside a capactior. If we assume the charge (Q) doesnt change the capacitance will increase but our voltage  will be less. 

This is because when you insert a insulator inside the a capacitor due to Polarization ([[Electric Force#Polarization]]). Initrally there is more + charges on the left and more - charges on the right, the charges themselves cant move.

When you insert a dialectric the opposite charges are able to arangle themselves to a electric field opposite to the orignal one.

With a dielectric the electric field decrases causing a smaller electric field. A lower voltage and by that a higher capacitance (assuming charge Q is fixed)
$V\downarrow = E\downarrow d$
$C\uparrow = \frac{Q}{V\downarrow}$

>[!note] Explanation
Without dielectric (at the top) the charge is just $q = cV$ and without a battery the equation to describe the voltage is $V = \frac{q}{c}$.
>
With dielectric the charge is changed due to the dielectric as well with measuring the voltage if the battery was removed.

Capacitance of a dielectric parallel plate is given by this equation, where K is the dielectric constant, $C_0$ is the capacitance without the dielectric 
$$C=KC_0=\frac{K\epsilon_0A}{d}$$

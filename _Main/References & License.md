## Textbooks & Papers
**University Physics with Modern Physics**, 15th Edition  
Hugh D. Young & Roger A. Freedman  
Published by Pearson Education, 2020.
Referenced for conceptual structure, topic coverage and some diagrams were inspired. All diagrams and wording are original unless otherwise stated.

**Pope, C. G. (1997)** – *X-Ray Diffraction and the Bragg Equation*  
Journal of Chemical Education, 74(1), 129–131  
[DOI: 10.1021/ed074p129](https://doi.org/10.1021/ed074p129)
Used as a conceptual reference for [[Bragg Law (Reflection)]], lattice plane interference, and powder diffraction patterns. No figures were reused; all diagrams redrawn in my own style.

Quarks are the things that make up particles like electrons and protons.

What makes up up and down quarks
$$\begin{array}{c}
u = d  + W^+ \\ 
d = u + W^- \\ 
\end{array}$$
Quarks of a electron:
$$uud = \frac{2}{3}e + \frac{2}{3}e -\frac{1}{3}e = 1e$$

Quarks of a proton:
$$udd = \frac{2}{3}e - \frac{1}{3}e - \frac{1}{3}e = 0e$$
# Quarks
Quarks are what make of particles such as electrons and nutrons.
There are differnt types of quarks each with differnt changes.
Quarks are created from the conversation of charge. Where the $W^+$ is 1e and $W^-$ is -1e.
$$\begin{array}{c}
u = d  + W^+ \\ 
d = u + W^- \\ 
\end{array} $$
The quarks were found expermentially and we wil assume it follows.

A up quark is denoted by $u$ has a charge $+\frac{2}{3}e$ 
A down quark deonted by $d$ has a charge $-\frac{1}{3}e$
 
 
# Quarks of A electron
If we used our assumptions before a electrons with a a charge of $1e$.

Will have:
$$uud = \frac{2}{3}e + \frac{2}{3}e -\frac{1}{3}e = 1e$$
This is the most simpliest configuration of a electron

# Quarks of a Proton
A protons has a charge of 0e so if we use our previous assumption the most basic configuration of a proton is:

$$udd = \frac{2}{3}e - \frac{1}{3}e - \frac{1}{3}e = 0e$$

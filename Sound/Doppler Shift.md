Doppler shift explain the change in pitch why the source of listener are moving relative to one another.

The general formula for doppler shift is that of 
$$f_l = \frac{v+v_L}{v +v_s} f_s$$
where $v_l$ is the velocity of the listen and $v_s$ is teh velocity of the source, and v is the speed of sound.
The convention for determing wether $v_l / v_s$ is postive or negative is the convention of the direction of where listener to source

When the listener is stationary the $v_l$ is zero
When the source is stationary $v_s$ is zero

# Speed of Sound in a medium
In any medium the velocity of sound can be found from the equation 
$$v = \sqrt{\frac{B}{\rho}}$$

# About Me
 My name is Rajeev and I'm a Physics student at the University of Waterloo. I started using Obsidian during my second semester of my first year, after I noticed that I was wasn't deeply understanding my course content. Obsidian helped me by visualizing the links between different types of content.

When I'm not on Obsidian, or doing school work/related things, I enjoy running and playing the Piano. I like classical music the most, playing and listening to it, although I mostly listen to it when I'm doing work...

# Purpose
After finishing my first year of University, I realized that almost half of my first year content I didn't **actually** understand what was being taught. I **could solve problems**, but **explaining** concepts to non-physics student **I couldn't do well**, nor did I perform as well as I wanted to with more conceptual problems.

When I looked up content, to help with my understanding of materials, more often than not did materials on the internet just say the information rather than explaining **why** or **how** behind it.

Then when I started using Obsidian. I started making better notes since I was wanting to make links to other notes and thus sub-consciously looking for ideas that linked to others.

I started understanding topics so much better since I could quickly skim over ideas to refresh my memory. If I forgot a topic that linked to an idea I was reviewing, it was much quicker to relearn that topic because of the links. Plus the interactive view showed me notes that a topic related or was referenced from.

**I created this website to help** future students or self-learners learn topics with a **focus** on understanding **why** and **how** to **while being short and simple**. The links in notes allows users to see areas they need to understand before starting on a topic, or quickly skim over topics.

# Important Features For Computers
Notes in this website are built in a way to **interlink ideas** with other notes. These are done in-case you **forget or need to better understand a concept that links to another**.
You will know whether a word is linked if you see underlined text that links to another note. 

Example, this note can be linked back to [[Welcome to The Math & Matter Website]], notice that you **hover over linked text to quickly view its content** (which is computer exclusive)

On the [[Welcome to The Math & Matter Website|main menu]], all folders are sorted by classes, and index files which holds the notes that belong to it. Click on the index files to view the notes that belong to that index file.

The **search bar** on the top left of the page allows you to search for specific keywords or note titles. For example typing "website" will likely show you results for the "Welcome to The Math & Matter Website" first along side other notes that use the keyword "website"

**Another way** to **search** is opening the files on the left side of this site, which will always be visible and holds notes that relate to the folder topic. For example this note is under "Site Information" 

In the upper right of this page, you can see an **interactive graph** that shows you the current notes that connect to this page. Connected notes will only show by default if a note is directly referenced in a note (a note is linked)

You can use the **interactive graph** to **quickly swap** between **connected note**, or expand the graph (top right of the graph) to show all connected notes (This is fun to play around), or expand the current linked notes.

A quantization of atomic orbital through semi-classical means give you the solutions:
>
$p_n = \frac{\hbar}{a_0 n}$
$E_n  = \frac{\hbar^2}{2ma_0 ^2 n^2}$
>
**Atoms jump states through absorptions:**
Atoms absorb photon with energy within resonance so the atom jump states due to it.
>
**Atoms lower states through emission:**
Atoms are higher energy levels are unstable the atoms wants to jump down states.
>
if a photon interacts with the atom at the right resonance, the atom releases a photon with energy to jump down states



An quantum orbital has both Counterclockwise and Clockwise wave. Meaning that p = +p and -p

For there to be ($\Delta p = 0$) we require:
$2\pi r = n\lambda$ (How many wavelengths we can fit into a circle)]

# Deriving Energy & momentum for nth wavelengths
From a classical approach we use:
$$
\begin{array}{c} 
F = ma \\
\text{From classical apporach we find the $p$} \\ 
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon _0 r^2 } = \frac{mv^2}{r} \\
\frac{e^2}{4\pi\epsilon _0 r} = \frac{p^2}{m}\\
p^2 = \frac{me^2}{4\pi\epsilon _0 r} \\\\
\text{Than we can find the KE} \\
KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \\

\text{Plug in $p$}\\
KE = \frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon _ 0 r}\\ \\ 

\text{Than from the condition above we solve for $p$ in terms of  $\hbar$} \\ 
p = \frac{h}{\lambda}\\
\text{Using $2\pi r = n\lambda$ and solving for $\lambda$} \\ 
p = \frac{hn}{2\pi r} = \frac{\hbar n}{r} \\ \\

\text{using everything above we can solve for Bohr Radius} \\\\
KE = \frac{p^2}{2m} \\
\frac{e^2}{8\pi\epsilon _ 0 r} = \frac{\hbar^2 n^2}{2mr^2} \\ 
r = \frac{4\pi\epsilon _0 \hbar ^2 n^2}{me^2} \\ Note: \\ 
a_0 = \frac{r\pi\epsilon _0 \hbar ^2}{m e^2} \\
r = n^2 a_0 \\ \\

\text{Solve for p in term of solved r} \\
p = \frac{\hbar n}{r}\\ 
p = \frac{\hbar}{a_0 n} \\

\text{from this we can also find the angular momentum} \\
L = rp  \\
L = \frac{a_0n^2 \hbar}{a_0 n} \\
L = \hbar n \\\\

\text{We can also find energy (KE)} \\
\text{knowing (Because KE = -1/2PE} \\
E = -KE \\
E = \frac{-p^2}{2m} \\
E = \frac{-\hbar ^2}{2ma_0 ^2 n^2} \\
\\\\

\text{Using this we can restate equation for any nth value}

\\\\

r_n = a_0 n^2 \\ 
p_n = \frac{\hbar}{a_0 n} \\ 
E_n  = \frac{\hbar^2}{2ma_0 ^2 n^2}

\end{array}

# How does an atom get excited into another state
## Absorption (Go up)
Where an photo with energy ($\Delta E$) an atom can receive that energy. 
This is only done if the atom in the correct resonance as the photon at the right time. When energy is given enough times the atom can jump states.

Think of it like a child on a swing. If you give it a push (energy) at the correct resonance as the child on the swing then energy is given to the child. If you push at the wrong time then energy is not given to the child. When enough energy is given to the child can swing higher (higher state)

>[!note] Explanation 
A photon interacts with atom in $E_1$ at the right resonance the photon gives the atom its energy and it jump states into $E_2$

## Emission (Go down)
When atoms are in higher energy states, often these higher states are unstable and the atom would rather be in a lower state (everything wants to be in its lowest energy state). When a photon interacts with the atom at the right resonace, the atom emits a photon because it want to jump to another state. Making it release a photon

>[!note] Explanation 
A photon interacts with a atom at the right resonance. 
The atom emits a photon to reduce its energy level

# What is Pascal Triangle
Pascal triangle is a triangle used to represent the [[! Binomial Theorem]]. 

It's a triangle array of numbers where each number is the sum of the two number directly above it. One of the direct numbers would be empty/zero then its automatically one.

Each row represents the coefficient expansion of $(a+b)^n$ (from [[! Binomial Theorem]])

For example:
$$\begin{array}{c}
(a+b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2 \quad \Rightarrow \text{Row 2: $1,2,1$} \\  
(a+b)^3 = a^3 + 3a^2b + 3ab^2 + b^2 \quad \Rightarrow \text{Row 3: $1,3,3,1$}
\end{array}$$

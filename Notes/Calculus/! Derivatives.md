# What is a Derivative
A derivative is specific type of [[! Limits]] as you allow the rate of change to approach 0.

Often is denoted as:
$$f' = \frac{dy}{dx} = \lim_{dx \to 0} \frac{f(x+dx) - f(x)}{dx} $$

It is the instantaneous rate of change, defined as a limit.

# Deriving Derivative of x
Using the formal definition of a limit and assuming $f(x) = x$ 
$$f' = \lim_{dx \to 0} \frac{f(x+dx) - f(x)}{dx} = \lim_{dx \to 0} \frac{(x+dx) - x}{dx} =\lim_{dx \to 0} \frac{dx}{dx} = 1$$

# Orthogonal Vectors 
In linear algebra instead of stating a vector being perpendicular to another vector, we say those vectors are orthogonal to one another.

When we say vectors are orthogonal to one another, we often point to their dot product ([[Dots Product & Angles]]) are 0.

**Orthogonal** vectors are whose their dot product is **zero**.

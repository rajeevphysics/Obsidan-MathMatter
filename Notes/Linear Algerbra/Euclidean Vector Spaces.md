## Defining a set of a vectors
If we have a graph with two axes ($\mathbb{R}^2$) we donate that point P by the distance across the x-axis and the distance across the y-axis. Such as ($x_1, x_2$) in linear algebra we denote this as  ${\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}}$ and we can generalize this for any point P.  ![[Screenshot 2025-06-05 at 9.21.50 PM.png|500]]

\mathbb{R} ^2 = {\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}} | x_1, x_2 \epsilon \mathbb{R} \\ \\
\text{We say} \space {\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\ x_2\end{bmatrix}} = {\begin{bmatrix} y_1 \\ y_2\end{bmatrix}} \space \text{if:} \\ 
x_1 = y_1 \\ 
x_2 = y_2 
\end{array}$$

## Proving Vector Addition & Multiplication 
>[!warning] Assumption
For this proof were going to use an example in physics, then generalize the solutions including multiplication 

Suppose we have a graph with two forces $F_1$ and $F_2$. We want to find out each force in $\mathbb{R}^2$ and then add the two forces together. After that multiplying $F_2$ by 2, we get the following results and graph.

$$\begin{array}{c}
F_1 = {\begin{bmatrix} 150 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}} \\ 
F_2 = {\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 150 \end{bmatrix}} \\ 
F_1 + F_2 = {\begin{bmatrix} 150 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}} + {\begin{bmatrix} 0 \\ 150 \end{bmatrix}}  = {\begin{bmatrix} 150 \\ 150 \end{bmatrix}} \\ 
2F_1 = {\begin{bmatrix} 300 \\ 0 \end{bmatrix}}
\end{array}$$

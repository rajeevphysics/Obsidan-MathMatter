>The magnetic field through a close surface is always zero but the flux may not always be zero.

If magnetic is moved close to a wire with current the current will bend towards the magnet.

**Key equation:**

Magnetic field:
$\oint \vec{B}\cdot dA = 0$

As well the flux can be found by:
$\Phi_B = BAcos(\theta)$

The magnitude of magnetic field through a carrying wire is:
$\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_0\cdot i}{2\pi R}$


# Magnetic Flux / Field
The magnetic field through a closed surface is zero [[Gauss's Law]]
$$\oint \vec{B}\cdot dA = 0$$

and flux through a surfrace can also be found:

$$\Phi_B = BAcos(\theta)$$

>[!note] Explanation
The field lines are circular and outwards which is whats noticed in experiment 
# Magnitude of the Magnetic Field For a carrying wire
For a current due to a carrying wire 
$$\vec{B}=\frac{\mu_0\cdot i}{2\pi R}$$
# Adding Magnetic Fields 
Being [[Magnetic Field Lines]] are vectors we can add them.

>[!note] Explanation
Because the wire is coiled in the same path, the magnetic field adds up.

# Bending Current 
If a magnet is moved to a flow of current, the current bends.
This is caused by the the Lorentz force:

## How does this Happen

If we have a postive charge and it moves with some velocity, and the current in the wire also moves with that same speed.

The electrons experience [[❓Length Contraction]] (although they are not moving near the speed of light) there are so many electrons and there attraction to protons are so strong the length contraction is notable.

>[!note] Explanation
A positive charge outside the wire will force the positive charges to be pushed away from the positive charge outside the wire.

Because both the postive charge and the electrons are moving with the same speed. In the postive charge frame of refernce there are more postive charges than negative charges because of [[❓Length Contraction]]. Because of [[Charges]] and the [[Electric Field]] the postive charge experinces a push away from the positive charges

>[!warning] Important 
Now if were stationary we say this is a magnetic field (but its actually a electric field just viewed in a different frame of reference)

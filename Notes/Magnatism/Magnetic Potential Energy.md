# What is Magnetic Potential Energy
Magnetic potential energy refers to the amount of energy a magnet will have in reference to where the magnet is. A magnet has more potential energy when its in an area or rotation where it naturally doesn't want to be. 

Similar idea to [[Gravitational Potential energy]] the more misaligned the magnet is with the field, the **more potential energy it has** it wants to align with the field

$$\begin{array}{c} U = -\mu \cdot \vec{B} \\
U = I\cdot A \cdot \vec{B} \\
\text{Because its a dot poduct we could also write:} \\
U = -\mu \cdot\vec{B} \cdot cos{(\theta)} 
\end{array}$$
To rotate the magnet must experience a torque  ([[Magnetic Torque]])

>[!note] Explanation
The less algined with the field the more potential energy is has, **Red has the most potential energy** and **green has the least**

If there is a magnetic moment, current carrying wire and magnetic field in different directions from one another, there will be a torque on the wire to align with the magnetic field.

Key equations:
$\vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu_0} \times \vec{B}$
$\mu _0 = I\cdot A$

# Torque on a current wire
When you have a current loop and magnet inside the loop with a magnetic field, the magnet moment  ($\mu _0$ / m) created by the current will experience a torque
$$\begin{array}{c} \vec{\tau} = \vec{\mu_0} \times \vec{B} \\
\vec{\tau} = IBAsin(\theta) \\\\ 
\text{Imporant note:}\\
\mu _0 = I\cdot A
\end{array}$$

The amount of torque is dependent on the angle with the magnet moment and the magnetic field. Max when the angle is 90 degrees.

>[!note] Explanation
Torque caused by the magnetic field and magnetic moment 


It's zero when the angle is 0 or 180

>[!note] Explanation
Three example of torque on a current carrying wire

We call the **<u>green box</u>** **stable equilibrium** since moving the magnet a small amount away from the magnet field will bring it back (Low [[Magnetic Potential Energy]])

We call the **red box** **unstable equilibrium** since a small disturbance will move the magnet into the green case (High [[Magnetic Potential Energy]])

>[!bug] Why is there a magnetic moment due to a closed loop wire
Due to an electric field inside a closed wire caused by special relativity and length contraction which in a our reference frames make a magnetic field (Read [[Magnetic Flux & Bending Current#How does this Happen]])

Electric potential energy is amount of energy a particle will have at a given location.

A particle will naturally want to be in its lowest energy state.

**Key equations:**
>
**Work of electric potential:**
$W = \int{F \cdot ds}$
>
**Electric potential energy of two point charges:**
$U=\frac{kqq_0}{r}$

**This is not the same as [[Electric Potential]]**

How much energy a particle will have at a given area.
**Gain** if you move it in a spot where it **dosesnt want to be**
**Lose** if you move it in a spot where it **does want to be** 

The potential energy formula:
$$U = \frac{k\vec{q}\vec{Q}}{r}$$

# Point charges in Electric fields

>[!note] Explanation
An electric field points down with a positive charge being moved downwards overtime.

The charge will **Naturally** go to the negative charge plate. So the charges potential energy **decreases.**
# Work of electric potential
The work of a electric field on a particle is independent of the path the particles take and is found through integrating the displacement, if we assume the force is always constant.
$$W = \int{F \cdot ds}$$
In this example the work is postive (Work is postive since force and displacment are in the same direction)

If we assume force is the electric field F = qE
Then we can rewrite the work as 
$$W = \int qE \cdot \vec{ds}$$
Remember that $W = -\Delta U$ so we often rewrite this as 
$$\Delta U = -\int q E\cdot \vec{ds} $$

# Electric Potential energy of Two Charges
The potential energy of a two particles is always this equation.

$$\left(1\right)U=\frac{kqq_0}{r}$$
Equation is always vaild and **depend** on the **sign of the [[Charges]]**
so when you have two like charges the potential energy is always postive, meaning they will naturally not want to be near each other

>[!note] Explanation
Potential energy of two like charges. Will never want to be near each other

If you have oppoosite charges the potential energy (U) will always be negative and hence want to be near each other

>[!note] Explanation
Two opposite charges, will always want to be near each other.

Coulombs law describe the electric field produced by a point charge and can explain the interactions of points charges

**Key equation:**

Electric field by a point charge:
$E = \frac{q}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0}$

# What is Coulombs Law
Coulombs law describe the force and interactions of particles. It explains and proves that point charges will produce a electric field and tells you how particles should and will interact with one another. 
# Deriving Coulombs Law from Gauss's Law (Point charge)
>[!warning] Assumptions 
In order to derive the general principle for columbs law well find the electric field produced at any point from a stationary point charge.
>
Well assume the following:
>- There is a point charge
>- Gaussian surface is symmetric 
>- Total area is $4\pi R^2$
>- Normal vector from electric field and dA are in the same direction
>- Equations from [[Gauss's Law]] are true 
>- Equations from [[Flux]] are true

>[!note] Explanation
Point charge with a Gaussian surface surrounding it. There is a electric field produced by the point charge.

$$\begin{array}{c}
\Phi = \oint E\cdot dA \\ 
\Phi = E\oint dA \\ 
\Phi = EA \\ 
\Phi = E(4\pi R^2) \\ 
\\
\text{By gauss's Law} \\ 
\Phi = \oint E\cdot dA = \frac{q}{\epsilon_0}
\\
E(4\pi R^2) =  \frac{q}{\epsilon_0} \\ 
E = \frac{q}{4\pi R^2 \epsilon _0}
\end{array}$$

A charged object will exert a force on another charged object. If they are like charges they repel and if unlike they attract
>
Polarization:
A negative charged object close to a neutral charged object. Postive charges move in the direction of the negative object.
>
Induction:
If a neutral object is grounded and a charged object is brought close to that grounded object the neutral object will become oppositely charged if the grounded part is taken off.

A charged object will exhibit a force on other charged object. ([[Charges]]) To charge an object you can ether use polarization or induction which is done because of Columbs Law. Which states that like charges repel and unlike attract, followed by the equation 
$$F = \frac{k|q_0 q|}{r^2}$$
>[!warning]
** this is different from [[Electric Potential]]**
# Polarization 
If you have a negative charged object close to a neutral charged object. The neutral charged object will have some of its postive charges move in the direction of the negative charged object (Neg-pos attract). 

>[!warning]
The charged particles will not jump to the other object in polarization.

>[!note] Explanation
Example of polarization positive charges from the left object will be attracted to the right object negative charges. 
>
No charges jump objects if they dont touch one another.
# Induction 
Charging an object by induction is when you bring a charged object near a uncharged object, without touching one object to the other the like particles will be replled and unlike particles will be attracted.

In this example you bring a negative charged object near a nutrual cone, so the unlike charges are attracted to one another. The like charges repell away from one another.

If you now add another wire, the like charges want to as far away as possible form the unlike charges, and so take that path. One you remove the ground wire, the ground is now negativly charged and sphere is postive charged.


# Electric Force
The force that causes this repulsion is called the electric force or Columbs Law. Columbs law is independent of the sign of the charges and only tell you the amount of force one particle exerts on another.

Note that like charges will always repel and unlike will attract one another.
$$|F| = \frac{k|q||q_0|}{r^2} $$
>[!warning]
When a particle exerts a force on another particle, the other particle will exert the same force back (Repulsion)

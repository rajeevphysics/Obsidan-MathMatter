Flux is how much of something flow through a surface
.
It depends on the orientation we use as the surface and the flow 
>
For 3D we imagine it as separate closed surfaces 
>
Key equation:
$\phi = E\cdot A$

Flux is seeing how much of something defined flows in or out an imaginary suface. 
We define this as $$\phi = E\cdot A$$Where A is an imagary area.

 Flux for 3D objects is positive when the field lines leaving the surface and is negative for field lines entering a volume
# Orientation 
Flux is dependent on the orintation that our imagary surface covers. This is because of the dot product.

To dertmine how the orintation effects our flux imagine a normal coming on the imagery area.

Our flux is zero when the angle between the area normal and electric field is 90 degrees. (The area would have been placed flat not penentrating that field)

# Flux in Closed Surfaces (3D)
If we want to find the flux coming in out a closed surface we use the same idea  for finding the flux in a electric field, and now consider how that flux is entering or leaving that surface.

For flux **entering** a **surface** we assume this as **negative** flux
For flux **leaving** a **surface** we assume this as **positive** flux.

If we assume this image is a rectangle with a electric file direction downward. (Assume E = 3, side length = 2 and longer length = 3)
>
For all the sides perp to the electric field we know the flux will be zero (Area normal is perp to electric field)
>
We only calcaute the flux through the top and bottom surface.
$$\begin{array}{c} 
\phi_{top} = E\cdot A =  3 \cdot 3 \cdot cos(0) = -9 
\quad\text{Entering} \\
\phi_{bottom} = E\cdot A = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot cos(0)= 9 \quad\text{Leaving} \\ \\
\phi_{total} = \phi_{top} + \phi_{bottom} = 0
\end{array}$$

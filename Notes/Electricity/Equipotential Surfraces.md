They are **perp** lines to the  [[Electric Field]]. The line (of equipoential surfaces) (BLUE LINE) are the area which the [[Electric Potential]] is the same (work is the same)

Red lines are the electric field

Equipotenital are always perp to the electric field, since they represent the line which the potential energy (work) is the same

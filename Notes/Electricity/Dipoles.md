A dipole is any two arrangements of two equal charges but opposite sign.

The field lines always point from positive to negative charge.
>
A dipole in a electric field will experince a torque along with a force by the electric field.

If a torque is produced there will be a potential energy created depending on the direction of torque.  (e.g: [[Magnetic Torque]])

# What is a Dipole
A dipole is any two arrangements of two equal in magnitude but opposite sign [[Charges]]. **The field lines always point from + to -.**

>[!note] Explanation
Example of a dipole

We define a dipole moment for a valuein-betweenn two points as:
$$p = qd$$
where q is the charge and d is the distance between the two charges.
# Torque on Dipoles
When you place a dipole in an electric field, the field produces an force on both parts of the dipole. That force will cancel each other, but the torque will add up.
$$\begin{array}{c}
\tau = \vec{p} \times \vec{E} \\ 
\tau = pE sin(\theta)
\end{array}$$

Dipole in a electric field exerts. The force produced by the electric field is canceled out

# Potential Energy of A Dipole
>[!warning] Assumption
If there is a torque on the dipole, then there must be some potential energy of the dipole.

The potential energy of a dipole is found from the argument that 
$\Delta U = -W$ and that $dW = \tau d\phi$  

We integrate to find the work needed, and our potential energy will be the negative of work because in order to increase the potential energy work must be done on the object, which will be negative.
$$W = \int dW = \int_{\phi_1} ^ {\phi_2}  pEsin\theta  d\phi= pE(cos\phi _1 - cos\phi _2)$$

so:
$$\begin {array} {c}
U = -pE cos(\theta)\\
U = -p \cdot E
\end{array}$$
>[!warning] Special Note
In order to get higher potential energy you have to do work on the object, which is not naturally done. And lower the potential energy is naturally done.

A dipole is any two arrangements of two equal in magnitude but opposite sign [[Charges]]. The field lines always point from + to -.

We define a dipole moment for a value inbetween two points as:
$$p = qd$$
where q is the charge and d is the distance between the two charges.
# Torque on Dipoles
When you place a dipole in an electric field the force experiences by the two charges will cancel out, but the torque will add up.
$$\begin{array}{c}
\tau = \vec{p} \times \vec{E} \\ 
\tau = pE sin(\theta)
\end{array}$$

>[!note] Explanation
Dipole in a electric exert a force on each charge due to an electric field.

# Potential Energy of a dipole
The potential energy of a dipole is found from the aurgment that 
$\Delta U = -W$ and that $dW = \tau d\phi$  
We intergrate to find the work needed and our potential energy will be the negative of work because in order to increase the potential energy work must be done on the object, which will be negative.

$$W = \int dW = \int_{\phi_1} ^ {\phi_2} d\phi pEsin\theta = pE(cos\phi _1 - cos\phi _2)$$
so:
$$\begin {array} {c}
U = -pE cos(\theta)\\
U = -p \cdot E
\end{array}$$
Note that in order to get higher potential energy you have to do work on the object, which is not naturally done. And lower the potential energy is naturally done.

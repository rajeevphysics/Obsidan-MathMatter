Blackbody radiation is something that producing all wavelength.
Classical theory like electromagnetic radiation cannot explain the energy in small wavelengths observed.
The energy of any wavelength is quantized
>
Quantized Equation
$$E = nhf$$


# Background (Ultraviolet Carpophore)
A blackbody is a type of emitted light that produced all wavelength by the electromagnetic radiation.

The sun for example, produced all wavelengths which most of it it we can observe. In classical theory electromagnetic radiation could predict small spectral radiance but deviated when predicting small wavelength (like UV)

>[!note] Explanation
The sun produced a blackbody radiation spilt into three sections UV, Visible and infrared.
Classical theory fails the most in UV
# Solution
Temperature is created by atoms vibrating (like a [[Simple Harmonic Motion]]), so the Quantum solution was to quantize this vibration like in a [[Quantum Harmonic Oscillator]].

>[!note] Explanation
Photo to show the temperature is created by vibrational motion.

To quantize this the vibrational energies the following equation was created:
$$E = nhf$$
where n is quantized integer (1,2,3...) and h is planks constant.

Which would describe any energy level of any wavelength as some nth value. Similar to what is seen in [[Quantization For Particle in a Box]] and[[Quantization of Atomic Orbital's]].

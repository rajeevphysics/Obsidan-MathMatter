>Pair Production:
A photon interacts with an atom the field by the atom allows the photon to convert some energy into mass. Which release an electron and anti-electron plus the photon with energy not converted.
>
Annihilation:
The electron and anti-electron collide and release energy due to the collision.

# Pair-Production 
A photon interacts with an atom. The photon gets close enough to the atom where the photon experiences a Coulomb field ([[Coulombs Law]]), the photon will convert some of its energy to mass, where it's recoiled by the energy left in the photon.

>[!note] Explanation
A photon interacts with the atom. 
The Coulomb field causes the photon to convert some of its energy to mass which is recoiled by the photon

The mass created by the photon is an electron, and a anti-electron is created because of the creation of the electron. 

# Annihilation
From pair-production an electron and anti-electron are created. To converse momentum from the recoiled photon the electrons release with some momentum.

If the anti-electron and electron collide they annihilate each other to release energy.

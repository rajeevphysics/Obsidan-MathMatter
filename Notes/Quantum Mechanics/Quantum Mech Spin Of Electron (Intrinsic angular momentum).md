One of properties of quantum mechanics (Type of angular momentum). Spin does not mean the electron is actually **spinning**.

## It's Quantized
For a electron it can have a $-\hbar/2 \space or \space \hbar/2$  spin state.
Doesn't tell us anything, it's like saying it has mass or energy can only affect another system

If we measure the electron spin in the x-direciton (we know it's 1/2) then we don't know anything about the spin in y-z direction 

>[!warning] Common Misconceptions 
Not a spinning motion (NOT SPINNING)
Not a arrow in space 
Something with a continuous value

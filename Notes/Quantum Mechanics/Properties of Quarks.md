# Quarks
Quarks are an elementary particle. They are composed of intrinsic properties such as charge, mass, spin number, and colour charge.

They are intrinsic meaning that they exist with quarks and particle  and cannot be derived or created by themselves.

>[!note] Explanation
Standard model table, which shows all intrinsic properties.

Also note $$\begin{array}{c} u \mapsto d + W^- \\ 
d \mapsto u + W^+ 
\end{array}$$

## Charge
Charges are a property quarks can be composed of. Mainly either $+\frac{2}{3}$ or $-\frac{1}{3}$. They exist in this way to allow for the formations of electron and neutrons who's electric charges are whole numbers.

## Mass
Mass is a property seen in many formations of physics. They tell us information of a particle and  exist to cause different types of things such as inertia or source of gravity in classical mechanics.

## Spin Number
Spin number refers to a property that particle are created with. They tell us the type of particle (fermion or boson from [[Fermion, Bosons & Pauli Exclusion Principle]]) and the type of behaviour that we expect from the Pauli Exclusion principle or [[Bose-Eisten Condensate]]

>[!warning] Spin Number Vs. Spin State
Spin number refers to the intrinsic property a particle has while [[Spin states]] refers to the state a particle can exist in at measurement.

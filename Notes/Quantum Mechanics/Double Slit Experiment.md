Double slit experiment is when particle enters through both slit simultaneously which causes wave-interfere patterns.


The double slit experiment is sending particles through two slits. They experience wave-like behaviour. 

>[!warning]
Not the same wave-like behaviour seen in the [[Single Slit Experiment]] (There is interference in two slit experiment)

>[!note] Explanation 
A particle with one slit open will have wave-patterns like in a [[Single Slit Experiment]] (First observation)
>
A particle with both slits open will enter both slits simutanusoly. Then the two wave-pattern interfere (third observation)

Notice how the probability of a particle through one slit alone (and the other closed) has some probability distribution but when both slits are open there is a interference pattern 

When both are open the particle is acting as a wave causing interference (goes through both slits simultaneously)

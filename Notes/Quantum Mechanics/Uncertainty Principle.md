Uncertainty principle explains how uncertain you can be about postion and momentum. 
>
Described by the equation:
$\Delta x\cdot\Delta p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}$
# Deriving Equation
The Uncertainty Principle was derived from the results of the [[Single Slit Experiment]] & [[Double Slit Experiment]]. The best to validate this equation is from experiential results and how $\hbar$ is derived. The equation found is the following:
$$\Delta x\cdot\Delta p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}$$

This equation provides how certain we can know about a position and momentum

## Extreme cases
$\Delta x$ = 0  forces $\Delta p$ = $\infty$ 
In a sense if we knew a particle position, we can't know anything about its momentum nor direction it goes in

$\Delta p = 0$ forces $\Delta x = \infty$ 
We know the particle direction and momentum but we have no idea where it could be in space.

## Particle in a Box Example
For a standing wave (n = 1)

>[!note] Explanation
Example of the n = 1 standing wave of [[Particle in a Box (1D)]] 

When we measure it there is a probability of where it could end up.
$x = 0 \pm \frac{h}{4}$ so:
$$\Delta x = \frac{h}{4}$$

For momentum because a [[Particle in a Box (1D)]] has both + and - momentum simultaneously when we measure it this collapse into either + or -, $p = 0 \pm \frac{h}{\lambda}$.

$$\Delta p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$$

# Photoelectric Effect
Caused when light particles interact with metal, which can eject a electron 
if frequency is small enough.

Because a particle acts like a wave and acts like a particle only when it interacts with materials, when the particle interacts with a metal the energy is given by $E = hf$ 


>[!Important]
So we can state the follwing:
>1. Minimum threshold freq is given by $hf = \phi$ (indep. of A or. $\Delta t$ )
>2. The collosion is almost instananous 
>3. The total energy in the particle is: $$ K_{max} = hf- \phi$$

Physical diagram of the photoelectric effect. Light interacts with a metal and in return ejects an electron.

> [!warning]
If you increase the intensity which lets more photons released (which could eject more electron) but it doesn't mean there is more ($K_{max}$) energy per photon

# X-ray Production
The opposite of the photoelectric effect. High speed electrons are shot near the nucleus of a metal. As the electrons moves near the atom, it gives off photons with some energy (which we see as light).

Similarly to the photoelectric effect $$E = K+\phi $$
where $K = hf$

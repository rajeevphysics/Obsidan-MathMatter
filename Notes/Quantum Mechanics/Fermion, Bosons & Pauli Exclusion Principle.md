# Getting A wave Function
>[!info] Assumption
We will assume two particles are indistinguishable in every way.

We get a function of this $\psi(a,b) = \psi(b,a)$. If we want to find the probability of finding this wave function we get:
$$\psi^2(a,b) = \psi^2(b,a)$$

If we take the sqaure root of the probablity function we get two differnt states a funciton can be in:
$$\psi(a,b) =  \psi(b,a)$$
and:
$$\psi(a,b) = -\psi(b,a)$$
# Fermion
When a particle exist as a fermion its quantum state whose spin are half integer ($1/2, 3/2$). 

$$\psi(a,b) = -\psi(b,a)$$

# Bosons
Bosons particles are particles that can exist in the same wavefunction.

$$\psi(a,b) = \psi(b,a)$$
# Pauli Exclusion Principle
This principle forbids fermion to exist in the same wavefunciton. This mean that for a fermion to exist on the same quantum state it must have a differnt quantum property. 

In QM this simplies to:

Having two particles with opposite wavefunction meaning they can exist in two ways. If we were to swap the postions of the wavefunction the wavefunctoin would be exactly oppsoite of what it is.

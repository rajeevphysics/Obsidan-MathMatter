A quantum harmonic oscillator is oscillator unlike in a classical sense has descrite energy levels, and can appear in region where classical are impossible.

# Classical Harmonic Oscillator 
In a calssical harmoic oscillator any system can have any potential energy depdendnt on how much energy you gave it.

In classical wavefunction:
depdent on the amount of energy you give it has turning points, because the amount of energy required to reach a point becomes negative.

# Quantum System

Unlike the classical wave function the harmonic oscillator in a quantum will have discrete energy system. Since $E_n = (n+1/2)(hf)$ 

Unlike the classical sense, the quantum one cannot have a zero energy level (due to [[Uncertainty Principle]]) and each one is quantized by it has a standing wave. The probability of finding a particle can be past the forbidden region due to [[Quantum Tunneling]]

>[!note] Explanation
Wavefunction only exist on decite energy levels (nth value)

For a quantum system to exist it need to have a wave function who's **normalizable** and **bounded** (standing wave) like a [[Particle in a Box (1D)]]

>[!note] Explanation
Quantum harmonic oscillator only exist in a decrite energy levels.

In the quantum ossiciltor this is possible only at certain values. This is physically only possible because this is the only wave a wave function can exist. **Note that a quantum system doesn't a force like the classical sense the so the wave function can't oscillate back and force due to [[Uncertainty Principle]] not allowing definte position

Solely because the wave function is quantized our energy is also quantized 

>[!warning] Important
The wavefunciton is decrite when the potential energy is less than the wavefunciton energy
The wave function decay exp due to [[Quantum Tunneling]] when the potential energy is more than wavefunction energy

SchrÃ¶dinger equation explain the wave function. With both real and imaginary.
$\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(px -Et)} = A(cos(\frac{1}{\hbar}(px-Et))+isin(\frac{1}{\hbar}(px -Et))$

# Deriving SchrÃ¶dinger equation
>[!bug] Important note
We are deriving a semi-classical SchrÃ¶dinger equation, because this is for first year semi-classical derivations

At the basis of this equation it defining a travelling wave where the probability being const at all time, not being zero at points. Real waves have zero at certain point (cos = 0 at $\frac{\pi}{2}n \quad| n\in I$)

Wave function of a single slit 

Real waves were created:
$$\begin{array}{c} 
\text{If we accept that $e^i = cos(\theta) + isin(\theta)$} \\
\text{A real wave (cos wave) is this: } \\\\
\Psi(x,t) = Acos(2\pi(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T})) \\ \\
\text{So a imaginary part of this would just be the indentical wave but a sine} \\

\Psi(x,t) = A(cos(2\pi(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T}))+isin(2\pi(\frac{x}{\lambda}-\frac{t}{T})) \\
\text{Note: the following is true from equations} \\
\frac{2\pi }{\lambda}  = \frac{2\pi}{h}p = \frac{p}{\hbar} \\
\frac{2\pi}{T} = 2\pi f = \frac{2\pi}{h}E = \frac{1}{\hbar}E \\
\text{So now the following is true} \\ 
\Psi(x,t) = Ae^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(px -Et)} = \Psi(x,t) = A(cos(\frac{1}{\hbar}(px-Et))+isin(\frac{1}{\hbar}(px -Et))



\end{array}$$

So from this the plane has both imagery and real

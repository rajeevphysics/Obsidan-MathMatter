# Single Slit
Particles experimentally noticed that going through one slit exhibit wave like interactions and violate F = ma.

Currently believed that particle can act **both** like wave and particle, called wave-particle duality.

Through experiments this function was created to describe the motion noticed in experiment. Where h is a constant.
$$\lambda \cdot p = h $$

An increase in wavelength ($\lambda$) increases the spread

An increase the momentum ($p$ ) **Doesn't change** the momentum of the particle but changes the wavelength ($\lambda \propto \frac{1}{p}$) 

Particle acts like a wave while moving but acts like a particle when it interacts with materials.
# Using HCP For One Slit To Calculate Angles
If we were to use [[Uncertainty Principle]] in a situation like this 
where we have a slit with length L and indefinite momentum we can calculate the angle.

>[!warning] Assumption
To derive the angle ejected into the slit we will assume the following:
>
>- [[Uncertainty Principle]] is valid
>- Angle can be found $\theta = \frac{\Delta P_x}{ P_y}$

To find $\Delta P_x$ we use the uncertainty principle for the x direction 
$$\Delta P_x \Delta x = \frac{h}{2\pi}$$ 
Since x = L our uncertainty can be as big as our slit width.
Simplifying and solving for Px we get (neglecting the constants terms)
$$\Delta P_{x}=\frac{h}{L}$$

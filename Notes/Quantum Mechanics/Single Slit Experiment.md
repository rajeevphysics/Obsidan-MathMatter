Single slit experiment points that particles experience wave like interactions 
Can be explained by the [[Uncertainty Principle]]
>
You can describe a the wavelength and momentum by the equation:
$$\lambda \cdot p = h $$

Particles going through one slit exhibit wave like interactions. (Not F = ma)

Currently believed that particle can act **both** like wave and particle, called wave-particle duality

Through expirments this function was created
$$\lambda \cdot p = h $$

An increase in wavelength ($\lambda$) incrases the spread

An increase the momentum ($p$ ) **Doesnt change** the momentum of the particle but changes the wavelength ($\lambda \propto \frac{1}{p}$) 

Particle acts like a wave while moving but acts like a particle when it interacts with materials 

# Using HCP for 1 slit to clalcaute angle
If we were to use [[Uncertainty Principle]] in a situation like this 
where we have a slit with length L and indefinte momentum we can calcaute the angle

Notice how we can find the angle using $\frac{\Delta P_x}{ P_y}$

To find $\Delta P_x$ we use the uncertainty principle for the x direction 
$$\Delta P_x \Delta x = \frac{h}{2\pi}$$ 
Since x = L our uncertanity can be as big as our slit width.
Simplifying and solving for Px we get (neglecting the constants terms)
$$\Delta P_{x}=\frac{h}{L}$$

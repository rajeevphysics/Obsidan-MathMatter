# Deriving Momentum For Particle in A Box (Ground State)
For [[Particle in a Box (1D)]] we allow only certain standing waves

$\lambda = \frac{2L}{n}$, $p = \frac{h}{\lambda}$ , $E = \frac{p^2}{2m}$ 

For ground state:
![[Pasted image 20250327105229.png]]
$$\lambda = \frac{2l}{1}$$ 
So we can find the momentum and energy 

$$p = \frac{h}{2L}$$

The momentum refers to the momentum a particle must have when measured to from this standing wave. 

## General form for momentum for any nth value

Well assume from the previous part the ground state is :
$p = \frac{h}{2L}$ 
>Assume the rate of which momentum changes is related to n


Where n = 1,2,3,.. 
$$p_n = \frac{nh}{2L}$$

When we dont measure it has a quantum wave having both +p and -p but when we measure it collapes into one standing wave

$$\begin{array}{c} 
E = \frac{p_n^2}{2m} \\
E = \frac{h^2}{8L^2m} \\ 
\end{array}$$
Like momentum this is the energy a particle would have to have if we measured it with this wavelength

# Classically Forbidden 
When we say classically forbidden take this example below to understand this concept.

For the ball to move up the ramp we need to give to a certain amount of momentum. Notice how the ball stops at some point because the kinetic energy is depleted. 

Area after the ball we would call classically forbidden because classically this part is impossible to reach because there is no kinetic energy left to make movement (Assuming we don't give it an extra push anywhere here)

# Tunnelling Through a Finite Wall
Tunnelling through a finite wall is the idea that a ball dropped at an edge of a wall will not have enough energy to escape the wall. But the wall itself is not inf tall and requires a finite amount of energy to complete.

>[!note] Image explanation
  The purple line represent the barrier a “ball” could pass over
  The ball doesn't have enough energy when “dropped” to reach past the top


The the energy is less then the energy needed to reach the top **Classically** the ball will not reach the top

However in quantum because of the imaginary part the [[Schrödinger Equation]] quantum allows this to happen.

## Exponential decay
In a classical sense for a particle to go above a ramp with negative kinetic energy is impossible (classically forbidden) but because of the imagery this is possible. 

know its exp decay (not derived in this note, but look at [[Schrödinger Equation]] more for info) because of the math behind it, but the physical reasoning is that it must decay because in a classical sense the particle loses kinetic energy as it moves more up in the ramp.

For the example in the first part ([[Quantum Tunnelling]]])
the classically forbidden parts have blue parts meaning in a classical sense they cannot be gotten to. 

For classically forbidden parts the wave function is a exp decay.
For parts a classical system could reach its would be a normal wave function like cos(x)

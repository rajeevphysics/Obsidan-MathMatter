# Static Model
The static model explain how static (or appear to be static) particles attract each other, which is from the electrostatic attraction like from [[Coulombs Law]]. 
*This is technically false if you assume how we observe the world since particles are not static and move with some velocity*

Example of the static model

# Dynamic Model
Electrons orbiting the nucleus are like how the earth orbits the sun. There is a centripetal force towards the nucleus
*This is technically wrong since the electron would spiral intro the nucleus which is not what is observed*

Example of the dynamic model

# Stationary Model
A particle (electron) orbiting the nucleus has both static and dynamic properties. When you observe it static, but is dynamic otherwise.

This model explain how a particle is able to orbit.
We can have $\Delta p = 0$ ([[Uncertainty Principle]]) making $\Delta x = \infty$ 

If the uncertainty is position in infinity than the particle has a equal probability of ending up anywhere in the loop. When not observed the particle is in a indefinite state appearing everywhere at the same time, with the same probability of being observed when measured.

$P(x) = const$
 $|\psi(x,t)|^2 \propto 1$ 

If there is charge everywhere than this creates a magnetic field. Which would now allow the electron not to collapse into the atom.

>[!note]
**There is no point charge orbiting the nucleus like the dynamic model, instead a single electron is everywhere at the the same time**

>[!note] Explanation
Magnetic fields are created by a point charge existing everywhere at the same time.

## Probability
A free particle with energy and momentum has this from [[SchrÃ¶dinger Equation]]
$$\psi(x,t) \propto e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(px-Et)}$$

Because the particle in a stationary state is orbiting the atom with angular momentum $r\theta = s$, replace the px with p(angular)

$$\psi(\theta,t)\propto e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}pr\theta-Et}$$
![[stat_4.png]]
[^1]
$|\psi(\theta,t)|^2 \propto 1$ 
$P(x) = const$ (because $\Delta p = 0$)

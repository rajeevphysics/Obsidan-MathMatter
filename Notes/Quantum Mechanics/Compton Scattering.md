# What is Compton Scattering
A type of wave-particle interaction on the atomic level. A wave of light interacts with an atom, and ejects an electron giving it energy and losing some of its own.

>[!warning]
This is different from the Photoelectric effect. In the photoelectric effect a photon with some wavelength will interact with an electron in a material giving that electron **all** **of its energy**. ([[Photoelectric effect & X-Ray Production]])

>[!note] Explanation
A photon with some wavelength will interact with the atom (well only consider the electron in an atom). 
The photon ejects the electron giving it energy, and losing some of its own.

# Deriving an expression
>[!warning] Assumptions
For this well assume that a photon will interact with 1 electrons ejecting that electron away from the photon as well as the following:
>
>- A photon will have an initial momentum ($\vec{p} = \frac{h}{\lambda}$) 
>- The outgoing momentum by ($\vec{p'}= \frac{h}{\lambda '}$) 
>- Electron recoil by $\vec{p}_e$
> - Electron energy is $E_e = pc +mc^2$ (Derived from SR)

**Momentum conversation** 
$$\begin{array}{c} 
p_e = p -p' \\ 
\text{Sqaure all terms} \\ 
p_e ^2 = p^2 + {p^2}' - 2p p' cos(\theta)
\end{array}$$
**Energy Conservation**  
$$\begin{array}{c} 
cp +mc^2 = cp' + E_e \\ 
E_e^2 + c^2{p^2}' = (cp +mc^2)^2 \\ 
\text{Sub in $E_e$ and simplify} \\ 
c^2{p^2}' + c^2(p^2 +{p^2}' -2p p'cos(\theta)) = c^2p^2 +m^2c^4 +2cpmc^4 \\ 
-2p p'cos(\theta) = -2cp' mc^2 \\ 
1-cos(\theta) = mc(\frac{1}{p'}-\frac{1}{p}) \\\\
\lambda' - \lambda = \frac{h}{mc}(1-cos(\theta))
\end{array}$$

# Explanation
When [[Cooper Pairs]] are formed they are in the same frequency as other ions creating photons (all at the same frequency)

When cooper pairs are cooled to this low temperature their two fermion electron most favourable state is to be as a boson 

So there spin's add up to form a boson:
$1/2 + (-1/2) = 0$
$1/2 + 1/2 = 1$

Since there is a boson they want to occupy the same quantum state which they can do now. Forming a cooper pair.
>[!warning] Electrons dont jump to different states
They arnt fermion then become boson, they always are fermions but act like boson because it's energetically favourable

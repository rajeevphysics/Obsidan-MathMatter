Bose-Eisten condensate occur when cooper pairs are cooled to a low enough temperature forming cooper pairs acting like a boson


When [[Cooper Pairs]] are formed they are in the same frequency as other ions creating phons (all at the same frequency)

When cooper pairs are cooled to this low temperature their the two fermion electron most favourable state is to be as a boson 

So there spin's add up to form a boson:
$1/2 + (-1/2) = 0$
$1/2 + 1/2 = 1$

Since there a boson they want to occuy the same quantum state which they can do now. Forming a cooper pair

They arnt fermion then become boson, they always are fermions but act like boson because it's energetically favourable

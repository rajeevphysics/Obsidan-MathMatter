Covalent bonding is a type of bonding between two atoms that will result in them to share an electron. They do this because its energetically favourable.

# What is Covalent Bonding 
A covalent bond occur when an two atoms share the same electron. This happens because sharing an electron is energetically favourable for the two atoms.
# $H_2$ Atom Example
For example two $H_1$ atoms which will share two electron with one another. 

In a quantum sense this occurs because the two electrons sharing reduces the overall energy level of the system.

**This doesn't violate Pauli exclusion principle** since the two electron although are on the same orbital, they have different spins allowing them to exist together.

A graph of this is this, where the wave function even (ground state) and odd (first order state) as well as their respective energy levels on the same graph

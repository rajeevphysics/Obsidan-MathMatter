Caused in superconductors from cooling a metal close to absolute zero. They are when two electrons overcome their repulsion force and act like boson, appear as the same wave function. ([[Fermion, Bosons & Pauli Exclusion Principle]])

# Normal Current 
In normal flow there is resistance caused by electrons hitting atoms releasing energy to the atom. The atom vibrate and the metal heat up. But in superconductors this is not the case

>[!note] Explanation
In a normal flow of current electrons reflect off an atom, where the atom absorbed some energy. This is resistance 


# How cooper Pairs Form
Orgnially cooper pairs have spin  ([[Quantum Mech Spin Of Electron (Intrinsic angular momentum)]]) Which doesnt allow them to be in the same quantum state as the other

This is why electrons are repulsed by another electron and attracted to a positive ion


In super conductors because the area is cooled so much, the atoms do not shake as much. With less shake the electon creates a higher area of postive charge (beaucase it passes thorugh between two postive charges and attracts both) the other electrons get attracted to this area

At long distances this attraction overcome the electron's repulsion form **cooper pairs** they act like one whole boson pair

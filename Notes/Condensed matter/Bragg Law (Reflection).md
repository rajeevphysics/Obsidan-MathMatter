>[!note] Explanation
Bragg plane with two idential reflection of two atoms of the same wavelength

If we assume in the figure above, that **AB and CD are the same wavelength**
We can check if they constructively interfere with each other.

We need to assume that they have the same wavelength, and they will construvitly interfere at some nth term. There is a nth term because even though both waves have the same wavelengths, they could have been emitted at different position or times.
$$n\lambda = d(sin(\theta_1) +sin(\theta_2)) \quad (1)$$
# Further Reasoning why Bragg law is true
If we assume the (1) is true and the interference with one another, **there angles could be different but still satisfy the equation**.

So we can check using another general apporch assuming
A beam (AB, CD) hit the top Bragg plane (The imagry plane shown in the Fig below)
The spacing between the incident and reflected beam are a spacing $l$ away.

>[!info] Note
We are checking between angles between two differnt beams (AB AND CD)

>[!note] Explanation
Bragg plane with two identical wavelength AB and CD with incident and refection angles between the two

If we assume this is true we get the following equation:
$$Path \space Differnce = l(cos(\theta_1) -cos(\theta_2)) \quad (1)$$
Now if we assume that the angles are the same the path difference equal to 0. If this is true then the two waves are in phase with one another.

# Assumption Derivation for Bragg Law
>[!warning] Assumptions of Knowledge 
This note derivation is used with a Bragg plane which is a imagery planes with the dots representing atoms.

>[!note] Explanation
Bragg plane with two idential reflection of two atoms of the same wavelength

>[!warning] Assumption 
We will assume in the figure above, that **AB and CD are the same wavelength**
So we can check if they constructively interfere with each other.

To check wether they are constructively interfere with each other  assume that they have the same wavelength, and they will constructively interfere at some nth term. 

There is a nth term because even though both waves have the same wavelengths, they could have been emitted at different position or times.

This equation is justified from those assumptions and reasoning:
$$n\lambda = d(sin(\theta_1) +sin(\theta_2)) \quad (1)$$
# Further Reasoning Why Bragg Law Is True
If we assume the equation (1) is true and the interference with one another, **there angles could be different but still satisfy the equation**. To be sure this law is true we need to check that the path difference is zero

>[!warning] Assumption
We can check using another general approach assuming:
>
A beam (AB, CD) hit the top Bragg plane (Figure below)
The spacing between the incident and reflected beam are a spacing $l$ away.

>[!note] Explanation
Bragg plane with two identical wavelength AB and CD with incident and refection angles between the two

>[!bug] Note
We are checking between angles between two differnt beams (AB AND CD)

If we assume this is true we get the following equation:
$$Path \space Differnce = l(cos(\theta_1) -cos(\theta_2)) \quad (2)$$
Now if we assume that the angles are the same the path difference equal to 0. If this is true then the two waves are in phase with one another.

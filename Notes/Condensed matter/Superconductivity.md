Superconductors are caused when you cool a metal to near 0 K. This causes the atom to not vibrate as much which lower the resistance if you pass a current through it.

When current passes through a a metal there is resitance caused by electrons hitting a atom causing it to shake, which doesn't happen in superconductors.

Meisner effect explains that there magnetic repulsion is due to electrons (orginally fermions) link up into [[Cooper Pairs]] and **act** like bosonic. Occurs only when metal becomes superconductive ([[Superconductivity]])


Because many electrons are in their lowest energy state acting as boson pair, there magnetic properties add up ([[Properties of Magnetism]]) creating a repulsive magnetic force

When a magnetic field is brought to the superconductor it expels this [[Magnetic Force]], when its bigger than gravity

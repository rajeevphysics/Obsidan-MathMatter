There are two main type of decay that occur, beta and alpha decay. 
>
Alpha decay occur when there is an even amount of protons and neutrons. For it to reduce energy levels it needs to let go of a whole energy level of protons and neutrons.
>
Beta decay occurs when there is a higher amount of protons ($\beta ^+$) or neutrons ($\beta^-$) for it reduce energy levels the higher amount needs to convert to the lower amount to create even energy levels.
>
For energy levels to accurately reduce gamma decay has to occur, which allows the atom to keep is mass but reduce its an energy but converting the energy into a photon, with some kinetic energy.


>[!bug] Note Assumptions
In this note we will assume Neutrons and protons inside a atom obey Pauli Exclusion principle and nuclear binding energy. ([[Fermion, Bosons & Pauli Exclusion Principle]], [[Nuclear Energy & Binding Energy]])
>
As well energy levels references are in reference to the fermi gas model. ([[Liquid Drop & Fermi Gas Model]])
# Alpha Decay
Occur when there is an even number of neutrons and protons. The most energy efficient way is to lose a fermi energy level ([[Liquid Drop & Fermi Gas Model]]). Which is does by letting go of a whole energy levels of protons and neutrons (Helium). It also loses 2 of its atomic number to create a new element.

Alpha particle have a lot of energy but because there so big they can't penetrate much of anything.

>[!note] Explanation
Shows the decay event of alpha decay 
Produced a daughter atom and emitted particle
# Beta Decay
Occur when there is a too many protons or neutrons. The fermi energy has an uneven energy level due to this imbalance.

It wants to be balances so either a protons or neutrons (which ever has too many) get converted into the other, while releasing energy as a form of other particles.

Because beta decay releases a smaller mass which has a high energy its able to pennate more than the alpha decay, but less than gamma decay.

## Beta Plus Decay 
Beta plus decay when there is too many protons (It created a new energy levels) so to balance this, the atom want to have an even amount of energy levels. So the protons converts into a nutrons.

Protons has the quark form $uud$ 
Neutrons has the quark form $udd$ 

Protons converts into a neutron and in doing so creates two new particles.

**For this to occur** $M_{parent} > M_{daughter} + M_{ejected}$ 

Proton on the quark level converts is $uud$ into $udd$
There is a mass difference because of this conversion so two new particles get emitted to convert this change.![[td_2.png]]

>[!note] Explanation
When a atom has more protons than neutrons (off by 1) it experience's beta-plus decay
## Beta Minus Decay
Beta minus decay happens when there are too many neutrons. For the atom to have even amounted of energy levels the neutron must convert into a proton.

Protons has the quark form $uud$ 
Neutrons has the quark form $udd$ 

A Neutron converts into a proton and in doing so creates two new particles.

**For this to occur** $M_{parent} > M_{daughter} + M_{ejected}$

>[!note] Explanation
When a atom has more nutrons then protons (off by 1) it experiences beta-minus decay

Proton on the quark level converts is $udd$ into $uud$
There is a mass difference because of this conversion so two new particles get emitted to combat this change.

# Gamma Decay
Unlike beta and alpha decay, **gamma decay doesn't release particles due to decay** but electromagnetic waves, and doesn't change the structure of the atom when decays.

Gamma decay occurs from the result of alpha or beta decay. These decay want to reduce the atomic energy level. But it by itself cant reduce the atom energy level.

[^3]
After alpha/Beta decay, the atom is still in its previous energy level. The neutrons/protons needed for it reduce to a lower energy level are gone, but it can't immediately reduce energy levels. It's in a excited state

for it to reduce it needs to release energy, but keep is mass (Photon). The photon released is a gamma ray.

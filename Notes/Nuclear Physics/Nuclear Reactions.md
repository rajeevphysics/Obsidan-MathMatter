# Basis of Nuclear Reactions
For a nuclear reaction to occur we bombard some atom with a bunch of particles with some kinetic energy (Different from spontaneous decay [[Types of Decay]])

>[!note] Conserved Quanties
>We assume that  charge,energy, momentum, and the nuclear number will always be conserved


In general to dertermine wether a nuclear reaction created energy or lost we assume that $E = \Delta muc^2$ is true.
$$ \begin{array}{c}
Q = \Delta m u c^2 \\ 
Q  = (m_f - m_i)u c^2 \\ 
If : \\ 
Q > 0 \quad \text{Kinetic energy is created, mass is lost} \\
Q < 0 \quad \text{Kinetic energy is lost, mass is created} \\ 
\end{array}$$
This is true because if we assume that our energy is conserved, than if mass the deceased our kinetic energy has to increase.

Lets assume we hit a lithum-7 nucleaous and it creates two helium-4 atoms. We can find the type of reaction and what will happen to the KE after the reaciton.
>$$\begin{array}{c}
\Delta m  = M_{before} - M_{after} \\ 
 \Delta m= M_{proton} + M_{Lithum} - 2M_{helium4} \\ 
Q =\Delta m uc^2 \\ 
If: \\ 
proton = 1.007825u \\ 
Litum = 7.016004 u \\
Heluim-4 = 4.0002603u \\ 
Q = 17.35MeV \\ 
Exoergic \to KE \uparrow
\end{array}$$

# Nuclear Fission
Nuclear fission occurs when you bombard a atom with nutrons at a slow speed (KE < 1eV). The atom absorbs the nutrons and then it decays into two serperate atoms relasing high amount of energy, as well a few other nutrons.

**How does the nutron get abosrbed**
If the neutrons is in the right place and at the right time, with the right speed the strong nuclear force from the atom takes in the neutron.  Nutrons are often slowed down by some modertor (water)

**How does the atom decay**
When the nutrons get abosrbed the already unstable atom becomes more unstable. Becuase of the high amount of protons the nutrons compacts all the particles closer together to the point where columb repulsion spilts the atom into two sperate particles. The surface tension then warps the two serpeate particles so they dont spilt again. ([[Liquid Drop & Fermi Gas Model#Liquid Drop Model]])
In doing so some nutrons can get released.

The release of new nutrons create a chain reaction. Which can be slowed down by control rods like graphite.

# Nuclear Fusion
Nuclear fusioon is combinding two atoms into a new atom.  

Two atoms under normal condition with repel one another due to columb repulsion, but under certain situi
ons (like high magnetic fields ([[Magnetic Force]])) the KE they get from the magnetic field overcome the repulsion.

When the two atoms are close enough for strong nuclear force to happen, that force dominates, and they configure themselves into a new atom. In doing so release KE and photons.

Sometimes the binding energy needed is so high it can be considered classicaly forbidden for the two atoms to combine, so they  exprenice [[Quantum Tunneling]] to reach the strong nuclear force

>[!example] Example 1
Consider two protons that combine to form some new atom.

>$$\begin{array}{c}
\Delta m = 4m_p - (m_\alpha + 2m_e^+ + 2m_{ve}) \\ 
Assume: \\ 
m_p = 1.007276u  \\ 
\text{After can be imagined as a helium atom with mass:} \\ 
m_{he} = 4.002603u \\ 
\Delta m = 0.026503 u \\ \\\
E = \Delta m uc^2 \\ 
KE = \Delta muc^2 \\ 
KE = 26.73MeV
\end{array}$$


>[!example] Example 2
Consider the sun which has an avearge KE of 4keV
The atoms that are in the sun obey columb repulsion.

PE = \frac{ke^2}{r} \\ 
KE = \frac{ke^2}{r} \\
\text{If w assume KE = 4KeV} \\ 
r = 360 F
\end{array}$$
**Notice how for atoms at the sun to make necluear fusion the distance needed for the strong nuclear force to work is 1F **

We need to account for [[Quantum Tunneling]] 
From [[Uncertainty Principle]] $$\lambda = \frac{h}{p}$$
If we assume $p = \sqrt{2m_p KE}$ than:
$$\lambda = 640F$$
**The wavelength is tells us the atom can qunatum tunnel to the point where they expenice the strong nuclear force**

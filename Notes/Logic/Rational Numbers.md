# Definition
Rational numbers are numbers that be written as a fraction of two [[Integers|integers]]. Mathematically this looks like $$\text{Rational Numbers = $\frac{a}{b} \quad | a,b \in \mathbb{Z}$, $b \neq 0$}$$
## Examples
The following are examples of rational numbers
- $\frac{1}{2}$
- -3 ($\frac{-3}{1}$)
- 0.75 ($\frac{3}{4}$)
- 0 ($\frac{0}{1}$)

The following are **not** examples of rational numbers
- $\sqrt2$ (proof in [[Proof by Contradiction (Indirect Proof)#Examples|proof by contradiction examples]])
- $ln(2)$

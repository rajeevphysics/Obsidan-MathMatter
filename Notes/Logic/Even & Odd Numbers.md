# Definition
An integer is said to be even if it is a multiple of 2. That is if we rewrite the $n$ as $n = 2k$ where k represent an integer.

We also represent even number if we can divide n by 2. Such we get an integer if after we compute $n/2$

An integer is said to be odd, if it has exactly 1 more than a multiple of 2. That is if we rewrite $n$ such that $n = 2k +1$ where k represents an integer.

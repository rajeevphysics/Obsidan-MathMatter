# Definition 
A conjunction is a logical tool that connects two [[Propositions |propositions]], which the result is only new proposition that is only true when **both** [[Propositions |propositions]] are **true**, otherwise returning false. [^1]

If two propositions are denoted as $A$ and $B$ then the conjunction of the two is described as "A and B" or mathematically $A \land B$.

A truth table for two propositions are described as the following:

| $A$   | $B$   | $A \land B$ |
| ----- | ----- | ----------- |
| True  | True  | True        |
| True  | False | False       |
| False | True  | False       |
| False | False | False       |

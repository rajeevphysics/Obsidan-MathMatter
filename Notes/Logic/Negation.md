# Definition
The negation of a [[Propositions|proposition]] is another proposition with the opposite truth value. Mathematically the negation of a proposition [^1] (if the proposition is denoted as $P$) is $$\neg P$$
In a truth table negation can be seen as:

| $P$   | $\neg P$ |
| ----- | -------- |
| True  | False    |
| False | True     |

## Examples
A simple example of negation can be said of the statement:$$\begin{array}{c}P: \text{The light is on} \\ 
\neg P:\text{The light is not on} \end{array}$$
In logic terms:
If $P$ is true then $\neg P$ is false (also true visa-versa)

As a truth table, this example would look like:

| $P$  | $\neg P$ |
| ---- | -------- |
| True | False    |

---

Another example well use the statements and the [[Conjunction]] statement of the following:
$$\begin{array}{c}
P: \text{It is sunny} \\ 
Q : \text{Is it warm } \\ 
P \land Q: \text{It is sunny and warm}
\end{array}$$
Then the negation of the conjunction statement is the following:
$$\neg P\land    Q: \text{It is not sunny and it is warm}$$

As a truth table, this example would look like:

| $P$   | $Q$   | $\neg P$ | $\neg P \land Q$ |
| ----- | ----- | -------- | ---------------- |
| True  | True  | False    | False            |
| True  | False | False    | False            |
| False | True  | True     | True             |
| False | False | True     | False            |

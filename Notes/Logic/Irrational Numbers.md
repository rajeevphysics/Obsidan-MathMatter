# Definition 
Irrational numbers any fraction of numbers that **cannot** be expressed as fraction of two [[Integers|integers]](a,b) and the [[Greatest Common Divisor (gcd)|gcd]](a,b) is reduced to 1. Mathematically irrational numbers are denoted as:
$$\text{Irrational Numbers} = \frac{a}{b} \quad \text{no } a,b \in \mathbb{Z}\quad b \neq 0 $$
You can find proof of irrational numbers through [[Proof by Contradiction (Indirect Proof)#Examples|proof by contradiction]]
## Examples
The following are examples of irrational numbers:
- $\pi$
- $\sqrt{2}$
- $e$

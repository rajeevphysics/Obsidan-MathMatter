# Definition
A predicate is a type of [[Propositions|propositions]] without a definite fixed value. Its value is instead dependent on one or more variables[^1]

## Examples
A simple example of this logic is $$\text{x is greater than 5}$$
Our predicate $P(x)$ is true or false depending in the value of x we choose.
$$\begin{align}
P(x) : x > 5 \\ 
P(7) : 7 > 5  \\
P(3) : 3 > 5
\end{align}$$
When we have values of $P(7)$ the statement is true, but with a value of P(3) the statement is false

A physical example could be something such as:
Let $T(x):$ "x is a triangle"
$$\begin{array}{c}
T(\text{Pizza slice} ) : \text{true}\\
T(\text{circle}) : \text{false}
\end{array}$$
The truth value of $T(x)$ is dependent on the value of x.

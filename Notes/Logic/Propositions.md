# Definition
A proposition is a complete fixed sentence. We give proposition a value of true of false mathematically. A proposition has no dependencies unlike [[Predicates]], it is always either true or false. [^1]

>[!note]
Sometimes propositions are called statements

## Examples
The following are examples of propositions:
- $7 > 3$ : this is always true
- 2 is an [[Even & Odd Numbers |even]] number: this is true by the definition of an even number
- 3 is an [[Even & Odd Numbers |odd]] number: this is true by the definition of an odd number

---

The following are **not** examples of propositions:
- $n$ is an even number: n is a variable and not fixed, so not a proposition (is instead a [[ Predicates | predicate]])
- The University is beautiful today: not a proposition as it is subjective

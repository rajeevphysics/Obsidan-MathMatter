Linear combinations are when we scale two vectors (who are scalar combinations of each other) by a scalar amount.  We can use linear combinations to find the amount of vectors we can produce in a plane.

If we had two vectors who are not linear combinations of one another in $\mathbb{R^2}$ then we could find linear combinations of all possible vectors in $\mathbb{R^2}$

The generalization of this is in [[Span]].

# What is Linear Combinations
>[!warning] Assumptions 
For this we will assume we are working in a $\mathbb{R^2}$ (for simplification) 
and [[Vectors, Vectors Addiction & Vector Multiplication]] are always valid 

Linear combinations are that combinations we can have when **multiplying specific vectors** by a **scalar multiple**. For example, if we have the two types of vectors with components, $v = i{\begin{bmatrix} 0   \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}} + j{\begin{bmatrix} 1   \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}}$ originally we get the following result of ${\begin{bmatrix} 1   \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}}$.

However, we can get many results if we multiply any of these components by a scalar multiple of each vector, such as  $v = 3i{\begin{bmatrix} 0   \\ 1  \end{bmatrix}} + 2j{\begin{bmatrix} 1   \\ 0  \end{bmatrix}}$ we can get a different result.

If we kept doing more, we could find all combinations of vectors in the $\mathbb{R^2}$ plane. 
If we plotted all combinations of vectors we found it would look **something like a plane**.

>[!note] 
We can still find all combinations of vectors in the $\mathbb{R^2}$ plane if we chose different vectors originally! 

If we now imagine having the same two original vectors in a $\mathbb{R^3}$. 

Then finding all the combinations of vectors in that plane plotted out we would get a plane which is what we got in a $\mathbb{R^2}$ plane. 

Now because we can only use multiples of the x, y all the combinations we can get are **only** in the x,y plane rather than covering all possible points in $\mathbb{R^3}$

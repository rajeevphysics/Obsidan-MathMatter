# Electromagnetism
The general basis of electromagnetic is the repulsion of two like particles. Which is dependent on the equation.
$$U = \frac{kq^2}{r}$$
But what is the dimensionless strength of this?
To find this well assume that $U = \frac{kq^2}{r}$ 
$$\begin{array}{c}
U = \frac{kq^2}{r} \\ 
\text{We want this to be dimesionless in terms of constant} \\
\text{ The only way to do this is to dived by $\hbar / r$} \\ 

\frac{U}{\hbar c / r}  = \frac{kq^2}{r} \cdot \frac{r}{\hbar c} \\ 

\frac{U}{\hbar c / r} = \frac{kq^2}{\hbar c} \\ 
\alpha = \frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon _0 \hbar c} \\ 
\text{Assume q is a electron} \\ 
\alpha \approx 1/137
\end{array}$$

# Strong nuclear Force
The force that hold protons and neutrons together in the atom. More fundamentally for holding quarks together.

The strong nuclear force has the equation
$$U_{nuclear} = -\frac{f^2}{r}e^{-r/r_0}$$
Which is attractive and its effect decays quickly

If we wanted to find the the unitless constant, well compare the nuclear force to the electromagetnic force

$$\begin{array}{c}
\frac{q^2k}{r} = \frac{f^2}{r}  \\ 
\frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon _0} = f^2 \\ 
\text{Dived everything by $\hbar c$} \\ 
\frac{f^2}{\hbar c} = \frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon _0 \hbar c} \\ 
\alpha = \frac{q^2}{4\pi \epsilon _0 \hbar c}  \\
\alpha \approx 1
\end{array}$$

# Weak Nuclear Force
Responsible for the quarks changing to different quarks' combination. Acts on quarks and leptons ([[Properties of Quarks]]). Responsible for different [[Types of Decay]].

The weak nuclear force from Yuakawa form.
$$V(r) = -g^2 \frac{e^{-mr}}{r}$$
From dimensional anaylis the dimensionless constant to describe this is in the form:
$$\alpha = \frac{GE^2}{\hbar ^3 c^3}$$
Where G is the fermi coupling constant and E is the energy of interactions

The exchange of photons which explains the columb repulsion. 
>
Key equation:
Number of photons = $kq^2$


When two like particles interact at a close distance the columb repulsion is due to a photon exchange with some kinetic energy. There is not an imagry force that causes this.

>[!note] Explanation
Explains how the electrostatic repulsion between two particles are actually due to photon exchange.

This exchange of particles if called the force mediation.
It is a imagery particle and doesn't obey $E = mc^2$ and can be created by energy

This particle isnt observable because we assume $\Delta t < \frac{\hbar}{2\Delta E}$ from the [[Uncertainty Principle]]

If we assume $\Delta p \Delta r \geq \frac{\hbar}{2}$ and $\Delta r \approx r$ we can find the force and N is the number of photons present
$$\begin{array}{c}
F = \frac{p}{t} \\ 
F \approx \frac{N\hbar / 2\Delta r}{r / c} \\ \text{If N is the number of photons} \\
F \approx \frac{N\hbar c}{r^2}  \\ 
\text{If we assume $N \cdot \frac{kq^2}{r^2}$ is the columb repulsion} \\
\text{Equate the two equations} \\ 
N\frac{kq^2}{r^2} = N \frac{\hbar c }{r^2} \\ 
= kq^2
\end{array}$$

$I = F\Delta t$

# General Principle
Linear momentum is a conserved quantity and describes how much force effects motion and is a intrinsic property 

>[!info] Important 
High momentum - Harder to stop
Low momentum - easier to stop

>[!warning] Assumptions
If we assume mass is constant and newtons second law ([[Dynamic Forces & Newtons Laws#Newtons Laws]]) is true.

$$\begin{array}{c}
\frac{dp}{dt} = \frac{d}{dt}(mv) \\ 
F = \frac{dp}{dt}  = ma \\ 
p = mv
\end{array}$$
# Impulse 
Impulse is the change in momentum over time. If we assume mass is the same like in linear momentum, we can derive a principle for impulse.

$$\begin{array}{c}

F = \frac{dp}{dt}\\
I = \int_{t_i} ^ {t_f} F(t)dt \\ 
\text{If F is consant the equation becomes} \\ 
I = F\Delta t
\end{array}$$

>[!note] Explanation
Impulse is the area inside F and t graph

>[!bug] Difference between Impulse and work
A **force** acting over **displacement** transfer **energy** - **Work**
A **force** acting over **time** transfers **momentum** - **Impulse**

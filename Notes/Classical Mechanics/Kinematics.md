# Motion in 1D
Kinematics is a description of motion in 1D such as displacement, velocity, and acceleration.

Displacement is how a object will move as a function as time. Displacement can also be found by integrating velocity, seeing how the area of velocity changes as a function of time.


Velocity is the rate as displacement at a function of time, or the speed at which this happens. Velocity can also be found by seeing how the area of acceleration changes as a function of time.

Acceleration is the rate of which velocity changes as a function of time.

>[!info] In general this is true mathematically:
Displacement = x(t) or $\int y(t)$
Velocity = v(t) = $\frac{dx}{dt}$ or $\int a(t)$
Acceleration = a(t) = $\frac{dv}{dt}$

>[!note] Explanation
Example of motion in 1D

In motion in 1D we can describe motion as an effect due to velocity and acceleration.

>[!info] Important 
The object **speeds up** when velocity and acceleration are the in the **same direction**
The object **slows down** when the velocity and acceleration are in the **opposite direction**.

We often describe 1D as graphs like in the figure, which can be useful to view how velocity acceleration and displacement change with time.

That figure graphs as a function of displacement velocity and acceleration

# Deriving General Expressions
>[!warning] Assumptions 
We will assume that in a displacement, velocity and accelerations case, the total displacement, is over the total distance is the integral of velocity over total time. (Same for acceleration)

In the case of finding displacement:

[^1]
>[!note] Explanation
Total displacement is the area underneath the velocity.

The total displacement can be found as this:
$$\begin{array}{c}
\Delta x = \int_t ^ T v(t) dt \\
\Delta x = v_{avg} t
\end{array}$$
Same idea can be done for velocity:

>[!note] Explanation
Total velocity is the area underneath the acceleration.

$$\begin{array}{c}

\Delta v = \int_t ^ T a(t)dt \\
\Delta v = a_{avg} t

\end{array}$$

# Projectile Motion
In projectile an object would have been giving a velocity upwards at some angle in normally two dimensions (x,y)

>[!note] Explanation
Example of projectile motion over a distance. 

In general, we would assume separate equations for two dimensions:
$$\begin{array}{c}
X - direction \\ 
\Delta x = v_{avg} t \\ 
\Delta v = a_{avg} t \\ 
\\
Y - direction \\ 
\Delta Y = v_{yavg} t \\ 
\Delta v_y = a_{y avg} t \\ 
\end{array}$$

| [[Mathematical Induction]]                  | Prove by showing it holds for 1 and showing it its true for n    |
| [[Proof by Cases]]                          | Breaking a problem into different cases and proving each         |
| [[Proof by Contraposition]]                 | Showing a statements conclusion is false thus statement is false |

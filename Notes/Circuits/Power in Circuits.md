Power is the work per unit time or the rate of energy transferred into a system by [[Current]] and voltage
(Units W)

$$\begin{array}{c}
P=IV \\ \\ 
Note: V = IR\quad  \text{So we often write it as }\\ 
P = \frac{V^2}  {R}
\end{array}$$
If there more energy coming in than there is a net transfer in
If there more energy leaving there a net transfer out

**Important:**
Voltage is the potential difference across two points. 

In the image below is there is more voltage **leaving** **then** **entering** the system then there is a net transfer out ($V_{ab} = V_a - V_b$) and so the **power will negative**

If there is more energy **coming** then **leaving**, then the **power will be positive**

Resistivity is a material that reduces (or stops) the flow of electrons
Conductivity allows this flow.

# What is Resistivity 
Resistivity is how much the structure of a material reduces the flow of electrons ([[Resistance & Ohm Law]]). Materials can do this because they can affect how many electrons are in **some area** ([[Current#Current Density]]), and effect **the [[Electric Field]].**

We define Resistivity as:
$$\rho=\frac{\vec E}{J}$$
S.I = $\ohm m$ 


Resistivity changes with temperatures:

Over small changes we can assume the change is linear (over bigger times its usually not linear)

If we let E = V/L and J = i/A
$\rho = \frac{E}{J}$
End with the result:

$$R=\rho\frac{L}{A}$$
# Conductivity
Unlike Resistivity, conductivity is how much electrons can move through a material ([[Current#Current Density]]) and how that material effect the [[Electric Field]].
Conductivity is the inverse of resistivity $\frac{1}{\rho} = \sigma$  
$$\sigma = \frac{J}{E}$$

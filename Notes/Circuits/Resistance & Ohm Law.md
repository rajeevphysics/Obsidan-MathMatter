Resistance (R) is the collision of electrons onto atoms, which causes the atom to vibrate and create resistance (heat). S.I unit of Resistance = $\ohm$

>[!warning]
Resistance unlike restivity ([[Resistivity and Conductivity]]) is the amount of resitence in a **object**. If you cut that objet is half the resitstance gets spilt as well.

>[!note] Explanation 
Bulbs dim due to there being more resistance present in the circuit. 
# Ohm Law
In the picture below we have a circcuit that connted to a conductor. The circuit creates an Electric Potential, which creates an electric force, which moves the electrons through the conductor (read more in [[Current#How does Current make electron flow]])

In the picture below it because of the movment of electrons in the conductor. There is a resistance from the electrons bumping into one another ([[Current#Drift Velocity]])

The resitance causes a less flow of electrons (Current = I) We define this as:
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$

Where V = Volt
I = Current 
R = Resistance 

# Resistance in Battery
Any real battery obey this rule

$$V_{ab}=\epsilon-IR_{int}$$

$\epsilon$ = electromotive force (or emf) what you measure the battery without resistance 
$V_{ab}$ is the voltage after resistance (any ideal battery V and $\epsilon$ are the same)

# Resistors In Series
$$R_T = R_1+R_2+R_n$$

For resistors in series you add up them resistors because the current through each resistor is the **same**, **voltage** would **change** 
(V = IR)

$$\begin{array}{c}
IR_T = IR_1 + IR_2 \\ 
R_T =  R_1 + R_2
\end{array}$$
# Parallel Resistors
**Current** would **not be the same** (Have to spilt), **Voltage** is the **same** (V = IR)
$I_T = I_1 + I_2$
$\frac{V}{R_T} = \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_2}$

$$\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}$$

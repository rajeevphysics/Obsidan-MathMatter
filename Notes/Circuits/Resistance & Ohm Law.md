# Resistance 
Resistance (R) is the collision of electrons onto atoms, which causes the atom to vibrate and create resistance (heat).

>[!warning]
Resistance unlike restivity ([[Resistivity and Conductivity]]) is the amount of resitence in a **object**. If you cut that objet is half the resitstance gets spilt as well.

>[!note] Explanation 
Bulbs dim due to there being more resistance present in the circuit. 
# Ohm Law
In the picture below we have a circuit that is connected to a conductor. The circuit creates an Electric Potential, which creates an electric force, which moves the electrons through the conductor (read more in [[Current]])

In the picture below it because of the movement of electrons in the conductor. There is a resistance from the electrons bumping into one another ([[Current#Drift Velocity]]) 
![[Pasted image 20250531202546.png]]
The resistance causes a less flow of electrons (Current = I) We define this as:
$$I = \frac{V}{R}$$

# Resistance in Battery
Any real battery obey this rule

$$V_{ab}=\epsilon-IR_{int}$$

$\epsilon$ = electromotive force (or emf) what you measure the battery without resistance 
$V_{ab}$ is the voltage after resistance (any ideal battery V and $\epsilon$ are the same)

>[!warning] Assumption
For resistors in series  the current through each resistor is the **same**, forcing **voltage** to **change** 
Assume that $V = IR$ is true

$$\begin{array}{c}
R_T = R_1+R_2+R_n \\ 
IR_T = IR_1 + IR_2 \\ 
R_T =  R_1 + R_2
\end{array}$$
# Parallel Resistors

>[!warning] Assumption 
Since our current will have to spilt, our current will not be the same, but voltage will be the same. 
>
Assume $V = IR$

$$\begin{array}{c}
I_T = I_1 + I_2 \\ 
\frac{V}{R_T} = \frac{V}{R_2} + \frac{V}{R_2} \\ 
\frac{1}{R_{T}}=\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2} 
\end{array}$$

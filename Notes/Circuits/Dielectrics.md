A dielectric is a material used between [[Capacitors]] acting as an insulator.

Dielectrics reduce the electric field inside a capacitor due to Polarization

**Key equations:**

When dielectric is introduced (Assuming Q is constant):
Voltage decreases
Capacitance increases by $C=KC_0=\frac{K\epsilon_0A}{d}$

# Finding Dielectrics 
>[!warning] Assumption
Assume we have a full circuits, with a capacitor with air separating the two plates. 

When a dielectric (Some type of material) is added in the space separating the two plates the following things are noticed.

>[!note] Explanation
When a material is inserted inside a capacitor it reduces the electric field.

>[!info] When a dielectric is inserted
There is a increase's capacitance (C) as less voltage (V) is able to move through. The charge (Q) doesn't change. 

When a dielectric is inserted inside a capacitor. If we assume the charge (Q) doesn't change the capacitance will increase, but our voltage  will reduce. 

**This is because** when you insert a insulator inside the a capacitor due to Polarization ([[Electric Force#Polarization]]) reduces the electric field.

>[!bug] Initial Capacitor  
Initially there is initially more + charges on the left and more - charges on the right, the charges themselves can't move.

When you insert a dielectric the opposite charges are able to arrange themselves to a electric field opposite to the original one. (Which is seen in the image above)


$$\begin{array}{c}
V\downarrow = E\downarrow d \\ 
C\uparrow = \frac{Q}{V\downarrow}
\end{array}$$

With a dielectric the electric field decreases causing a smaller electric field. A lower voltage and by that a higher capacitance (assuming charge Q is fixed)

>[!note] Explanation
Without dielectric (at the top) the charge is just $q = cV$ and without a battery the equation to describe the voltage is $V = \frac{q}{c}$.
>
With dielectric the charge is changed due to the dielectric as well with measuring the voltage if the battery was removed.

Capacitance of a dielectric parallel plate is given by this equation, where K is the dielectric constant, $C_0$ is the capacitance without the dielectric 
$$C=KC_0=\frac{K\epsilon_0A}{d}$$

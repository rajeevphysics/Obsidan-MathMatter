# Junction Rule
For parallel [[Current]] we can use this rule to add the current.
$$\sum I = 0$$

The sum of the current in - current out = 0

Example of junction rule, where current spilts (or can add up in reverse of this image)

# Loop Rule
Any closed loop should obey this voltage rule 

$$\sum V = 0$$
Voltage in - Voltage out = 0

We are allowed to say this because voltage is a conserved quantity if it's not lost to something it should always be conserved

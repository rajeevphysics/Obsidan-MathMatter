# Important Distinction 
The motion of negative [[Charges]] (electrons) is  conventual current we will assume this for this note and in general. 

Metallic conductors we say current is the flow of positive charges.

Current only flow when a circuit is closed:![[cur_1.png]]
>[!note] Explanation
Example of current flowing through two situations

>[!Important]
Bulbs and any electrical device do not use up current (Current is lost due to resistance)
Current is always the same everywhere in a system 

# How does Current make electron flow
If we assume we have a closed battery with a conductor. Current is created when we connect a Potential difference created by [[Electric Potential Energy]]. This electric potential difference creates an [[Electric Field]] inside the conductor 
$$E = \frac{V}{L}$$
![[cur_2.png | 500]]
>[!note] Explanation
The electric field creates an [[Electric Force]] (F = qE) which is what pushes the electrons through a conductor.
# Drift Velocity
Drift velocity is due to [[Resistance & Ohm Law]] and is when the current moving through a current hit each other (due to resistance) the velocity is changed.
We note this as $$v_d = \frac{D}{t}$$
Which represents the average drift velocity over a distance (D) covered over time (t).

Drift velocity inside a wire

If we define n as the number of charges (N) over the volume of a area, and q is the [[Charges]] We can define the current as:
$$I = \frac{dQ}{dt} = nqv_dA$$

## Types
DC = Direction current flows in one direction
AC = Alternating current reverses direction many times per second
$$I=\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}$$


# Current Density
The density of the current is noted by $\vec{J}$  and is the density of current by area.

Note that our current can also be described as $I = nqv_d A$

$$\vec{J}=\frac{I}{A}=\frac{qnv_{d}A}{A}=qnv_{d}$$

>[!warning]
The current density is always the same as the electric field
We can use current density to find the avg charge Q for things like [[Gauss's Law]]
$$Q = \int J \cdot dA$$

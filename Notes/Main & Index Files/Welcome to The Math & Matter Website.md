# About
This is ongoing project to help students better understand and find resources they need easier and faster. This project has been developing for many months and is still being constantly worked on by just me.

I'm a Physics student at the University of Waterloo and work on this site in my free time. If you would like to reach out to me send me an [email](mailto:rajeevpersaud31@gmail.com).

If you want to learn more about this project, or keep in touch with development head over to my [Github Page](https://github.com/rajeevphysics/University-Physics-Notes-Vault)

Currently, this vault is in v1.0.1, included are:
> 95 notes
> 347 links to notes  
> 277 attachments & images
> 27,312 total words across all notes
# How to Submit an Error & Feedback
If you found a error in any note, notes are hard to understand/ not written well, or want to see some type of note that is not included. Head over to my [Github Issue Page](https://github.com/rajeevphysics/thinkbook/issues)
and submit an issue request!
# How to Support
Currently this project is maintained through [Obsidian Publish](https://obsidian.md/publish) which is a payed service. Any donations or sponsors will help directly support the continuation of this project. 

Any donations are appreciated!

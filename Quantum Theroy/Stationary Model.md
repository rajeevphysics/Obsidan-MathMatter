# Stationary Model
A particle (electron) orbiting the nuclelus has both static and dynamic properties. When you observe it static, but is dynamic otherwise.

This model explain how a particle is able to orbit.
We can have $\Delta p = 0$ ([[Uncertainty Principle]]) making $\Delta x = \infty$ 

If the uncerainty is postion in infity than the particle has a equal problibity of eneding up anywhere in the loop. When not observed the particle is in a indefinte state appearing everywhere at the same time, with the same probability of being observed when measured.

$P(x) = const$
 $|\psi(x,t)|^2 \propto 1$ 

If there is charge everywhere than this creates a magnetic field. Which would now allow the electron not to collape into the atom.

>[!note]
**there is no point charge orbiting the nucleuss like the dynamic model, instead a single electron is everwhere at the the same time**

# Probability
A free particle with energy and monentum has this:
$$\psi(x,t) \propto e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}(px-Et)}$$

Because the particle in a stationary state is orbiting the atom with angular momentum $r\theta = s$, replace the px with p(angular)

$$\psi(\theta,t)\propto e^{\frac{i}{\hbar}pr\theta-Et}$$

$|\psi(\theta,t)|^2 \propto 1$ 
$P(x) = const$ (because $\Delta p = 0$)

# Static Model
The static model explain how static (or appear to be static) particles attract each other, which is from the electronstatic attraction. *This is technically false if you assume how we observe the world since partcles are not static and move*

# Dynamic Model

Electrons obiting the nucleus are like how the earth orbits the sun. There is a centripcal force towards teh nucleaus
*This is techically wrong since the electron woudl spiral intro the nucleaus which is not what is oberseved*

A single particle obiting the nucleaus would create EM waves
